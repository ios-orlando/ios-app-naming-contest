# iOS Orlando Community App Naming Contest

We're holding a naming contest for our new community iOS app. The app will provide a way for our community to communicate, share ideas, find out about future events we're planning, as well as review previous events.

Request for suggestions will close on 9/11/19 and a poll will be posted on our Twitter [@iOSOrlando](https://twitter.com/iosorlando). The poll will run until our next meetup on 9/18/19 where we'll announce the winner!

The winner will receive a free download of Paul Hudson's Swift Power Pack. It's three separate books on the latest in Swift and iOS programming.

To participate, please fork this repo and add your name suggestions to this README. Then issue a PR against the original repo to submit.
